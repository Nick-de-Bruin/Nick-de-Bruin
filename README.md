## Hi, I'm Nick ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying a Master in [Game and Media Technology](https://students.uu.nl/en/science/game-and-media-technology) at Utrecht University.

I currently mainly use this GitHub account for personal projects (and sometimes coursework). If you want to learn more about, you can find up to date information on https://nickdebruin.me/.

I'm interested in graphics, simulations, and emergent behavior. If you want to chat about these topics, or have a question about one of my repositories, the easiest way to contact me is through sending me an email or contacting me on Discord at `n_1ck`.
