## Hi, I'm Nick 👋

I currently mainly use this GitHub account for personal projects. If you want to learn more about, you can find up to date information on https://nickdebruin.me/.

I'm interested in graphics, simulations, and emergent behavior. If you want to chat about these topics, or have a question about one of my repositories, the easiest way to contact me is through sending me an email.
